# tic-tac-toe
Hey guys, so I decided to post my first pygame project here and try to improve by practicing more and helping others!
Please if you like it, give me some feedback :) 
Also I really appreciate people who try to fix erros/bugs or simply make the program more readable and more enjoyable..
Thank youu for reading this!!
